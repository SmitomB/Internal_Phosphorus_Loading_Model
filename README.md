Phosphorus is often a limiting nutrient for eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs across the world. While most management strategies aim at reducing external phosphorus sources, internal loading often receives less attention, as it is difficult to measure or quantify through modeling. However, internal loading can be a serious challenge to water quality improvement, especially following external loading reductions. Here, we present a new approach to quantify internal loading dynamics in a segmented reservoir leveraging long-term routine surface-water quality data. Our approach utilizes a parsimonious mass-balance model within a Bayesian inference framework. The model performs well (R2 = 57% and RMSE = 0.032 mg/L) when applied to a eutrophic reservoir (Jordan Lake, North Carolina, USA). Results highlight the dominant role of internal loading in summers (0.53 g/m2/mo), contributing nearly twice the external loading. Interestingly, when applied for future projections under different climate scenarios, our model simulations indicate negligible differences in total phosphorus trajectories, despite higher internal loading under warmer climate. Such a situation is plausible due to comparable increases in sediment recycling and effective settling rates  (all else being equal). Additionally, we investigate the long-term phosphorus dynamics under different external and internal loading management scenarios. For a reservoir with significant internal loading, in-lake management    alone can bring out immediate water quality improvements but raises questions about long-term sustainability. On the other hand, it will take decades for the benefits of external loading reductions to be fully realized.   For our study system, it will take around 80 years to bring about a 40% reduction in phosphorus concentrations following 50% external loading reductions. The best results are obtained with a combination of internal and external loading reductions.
